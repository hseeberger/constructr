# ConstructR #

ConstructR aims at cluster bootstrapping (construction) by using a coordination service. Currently it provides libraries for bootstrapping [Akka](http://akka.io) and [Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org) clusters via [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd).

Disambiguation: Despite the similar name, ConstructR is not related to [Lightbend ConductR](http://www.lightbend.com/products/conductr).

ConstructR utilizes a key-value coordination service like etcd to automate bootstrapping or joining a cluster. It stores each member node under the key `/constructr/$prefix/$clusterName/nodes/$address` where `$prefix` represents the system to be clustered, e.g. "akka", `$clusterName` is for disambiguating multiple clusters and `$address` is a Base64 encoded address, e.g. `Address` for Akka. These keys expire after a configurable time in order to avoid stale information. Therefore ConstructR refreshes each key periodically.

In a nutshell, ConstructR is a state machine which first tries to get the nodes from the coordination service. If none are available it tries to acquire a lock, e.g. via a CAS write for etcd, and uses itself or retries getting the nodes. Then it joins using these nodes as seed nodes. After that it adds its address to the nodes and starts the refresh loop:

```

```

If something goes finally wrong when interacting with the coordination service, e.g. a permanent timeout after a configurable number of retries, ConstructR terminates its `ActorSystem` in the spirit of "fail fast".

## ConstructR for Akka

``` scala
// All releases including intermediate ones are published here,
// final ones are also published to Maven Central.
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hseeberger", "maven")

libraryDependencies ++= Vector(
  "de.heikoseeberger" %% "constructr-akka" % "0.13.2",
  ...
)
```

Simply add the `ConstructrExtension` to the `extensions` configuration setting:

```
akka.extensions = [de.heikoseeberger.constructr.akka.ConstructrExtension]
```

This will start the `Constructr` actor as a system actor. Alternatively start it yourself as early as possible if you feel so inclined.

The following listing shows the available configuration settings with their defaults:

```
constructr {
  coordination {
    host = localhost
    port = 2379
  }

  coordination-timeout = 3 seconds  // Maximum response time for coordination service (e.g. etcd)
  max-nr-of-seed-nodes = 0          // Any nonpositive value means Int.MaxValue
  nr-of-retries        = 2          // Nr. of tries are nr. of retries + 1
  refresh-interval     = 30 seconds // TTL is refresh-interval * ttl-factor
  retry-delay          = 3 seconds  // Give coordination service (e.g. etcd) some delay before retrying
  ttl-factor           = 2.0        // Must be greater or equal 1 + ((coordination-timeout * (1 + nr-of-retries) + retry-delay * nr-of-retries)/ refresh-interval)!

  join-timeout = 15 seconds // Might depend on cluster size and network properties
}
```

## ConstructR for Cassandra

``` scala
// All releases including intermediate ones are published here,
// final ones are also published to Maven Central.
resolvers += Resolver.bintrayRepo("hseeberger", "maven")

libraryDependencies ++= Vector(
  "de.heikoseeberger" %% "constructr-cassandra" % "0.13.2",
  ...
)
```

Simply (LOL) configure the `ConstructrSeedProvider` under the `seed_provider` configuration setting:

```
seed_provider:
    - class_name: de.heikoseeberger.constructr.cassandra.ConstructrSeedProvider
```

If you want to run Cassandra in Docker, ConstructR provides the [constructr/cassandra-3.3](https://hub.docker.com/r/constructr/cassandra-3.3) Docker image with the necessary configuration.

The following listing shows the available configuration settings with their defaults:

```
constructr {
  coordination {
    host = localhost
    host = ${?CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS} // Works for Docker image
    port = 2379
  }

  coordination-timeout = 3 seconds  // Maximum response time for coordination service (e.g. etcd)
  max-nr-of-seed-nodes = 0          // Any nonpositive value means Int.MaxValue
  nr-of-retries        = 2          // Nr. of tries are nr. of retries + 1
  refresh-interval     = 30 seconds // TTL is refresh-interval * ttl-factor
  retry-delay          = 3 seconds  // Give coordination service (e.g. etcd) some delay before retrying
  ttl-factor           = 2.0        // Must be greater or equal 1 + ((coordination-timeout * (1 + nr-of-retries) + retry-delay * nr-of-retries)/ refresh-interval)!

  cluster-name          = default                         // Must match cluster_name in cassandra.yaml!
  cluster-name          = ${?CASSANDRA_CLUSTER_NAME}      // Works for Docker image
  seed-provider-timeout = 20 seconds                      // Should be longer than coordination-timeout
  self-address          = auto                            // "auto" means `InetAddress.getLocalHost`
  self-address          = ${?CASSANDRA_BROADCAST_ADDRESS} // Works for Docker image
}
```

## Coordination

ConstructR comes with out-of-the-box support for etcd: simply depend on the "constructr-coordination-etcd" module. If you want to use some other coordination backend, e.g. Consul, simply implement the `Coordination` trait from the "constructr-coordination" module and make sure to provide the fully qualified class name via the `constructr.coordination.class-name` configuration setting.

### Community Coordination Implementations

There are some implementations for other coordination backends than etcd:

* [Tecsisa/constructr-consul](https://github.com/Tecsisa/constructr-consul): This library enables to use Consul as cluster coordinator in a ConstructR based cluster.
* [everpeace/constructr-redis](https://github.com/everpeace/constructr-redis): This library enables to use Redis as cluster coordinator in a ConstructR based cluster.

## Testing

etcd must be running, e.g.:

```
docker run \
  --detach \
  --name etcd \
  --publish 2379:2379 \
  quay.io/coreos/etcd:v2.3.6 \
  --listen-client-urls http://0.0.0.0:2379 \
  --advertise-client-urls http://192.168.99.100:2379
```
